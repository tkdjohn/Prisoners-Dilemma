# Student's Dilemma
It's you versus a fellow **CodeLouisville** student (played by the computer). You both have been caught cheating on your final project, however it isn't clear whether one of you plagiarized the other's project or if you were both plagiarized from an outside source. You have been offered a deceptively simple choice: confess or not. 

However, there are conditions:
- If you both confess: You both will fail the class, but in light of your honesty, both will be allowed to re-take the class next session. (0 points)
- If one of you confesses and the other does not: 
  - The student who confesses will be allowed to submit a new project by the original deadline, and potentially pass the course (2 points). 
  - The student who does not confess will fail, be expelled and banned from ever taking another Code Louisville course, and worst of all will receive a red X on their permanent record. (-5 points)  
 - If neither of you confesses: You both will fail the class and will not be allowed to take the course again, but you will not be expelled from the program. (-2 points)

You will have between five and fifteen chances to try and outwit the computer. For the purposes of the game, each possible outcome is awarded a numeric point value (in parentheses  above)
